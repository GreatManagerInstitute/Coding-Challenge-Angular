**Tech Requirements:**

- Angular 2+

**API**
=====
Url : https://api-uat.greatmanagerinstitute.com/task/getTrailerList

The API Handles the request by sending back an array or links to various Youtube Trailer videos.


**Task**
=====

1. A Playlist Section with all the available videos from the API.
2. A Video Player Section that plays the selected video
3. Load the newly selected video from the playlist to the video player
4. The API requires a `Source` header so use a request interceptor to send it on every request
5. The Angular Components should communicate with each other using a Parent Child Relation and not Events. (For Ex: The Playlist and Video Player should be 2 different components ) 
6. Add in a custom transform pipe to convert the Title of the video to Uppercase
7. Avoid using any kind of HTML/CSS framework.
8. A Carousel for scrolling through the playlist
9. Toast Message for an Error on Bad Requests or Incorrect Request Params

- Get to know your Knowledge of dealing with an External API
- Visualisation of Data from that API
